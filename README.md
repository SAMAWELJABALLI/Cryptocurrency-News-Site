# Cryptocurrency-News-Site
#### Cryptocurrencies are all the rage right now. Wouldn't it be cool to build a website that shows Crypto news automatically? In this context, I have built a website using Django (version 2.0.7) and Python (version 3.7.0) and Bootstrap (version 4.1.1) that connects to a free third party crypto API. I will be able to pull news stories, crypto price data, and all kinds of cool stuff, and output it onto the screen of our website automatically.
